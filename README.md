# Iris_Classifier
# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification (Machine Learning Project)

This project classifies iris flowers into three species using supervised machine learning techniques. It is based on the classic **Iris dataset** — one of the most popular datasets used for pattern recognition.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a machine learning model that accurately classifies the type of iris flower based on 4 input features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Target labels (species):
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy & Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (Modeling, preprocessing, evaluation)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Pair plots to visualize feature distribution
- Heatmap to understand feature correlations
- Box plots to compare distributions among classes

---

## 🧪 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

✅ All models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

---

## 📈 Preprocessing Steps

- Standardized input features using `StandardScaler`
- Split dataset into training and test sets (80/20)
- Encoded species labels for training
- Trained models and compared accuracy
